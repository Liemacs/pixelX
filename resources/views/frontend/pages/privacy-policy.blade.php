        <h3>4. Types of personal data we process</h3>
        <p>“Personal data” means information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not
            include data where an individual’s identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>
        <p>Throughout this privacy notice we use the term "processing" to refer to all activities involving your personal
            data, including collecting, handling, storing, sharing, accessing, using, transferring, erasing and disposing of
            it.</p>
        <p>The personal data we collect about you depends on the particular activities carried out through our website. For
            example, we collect different types of personal data depending on whether you create a user account, purchase
            Codes or only browse the website. Typically we collect and process the following kinds of personal data:
        <ul>
            <li>Identity and Contact Data includes your name, postal address, email address, date of birth and any personal
                data provided when contacting us and in the case of pixel partners, any personal data provided in
                the course of our partnership;</li>
            <li>Financial Data includes information necessary for processing payments and fraud prevention, and in respect
                of pixel partners this includes all billing-related information. If you pay us by payment card this

            <li>Transaction Data includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services
                you have purchased from us, and in the case of pixel partners this includes personal data relating
                to the administration, management and performance of our business relationship;</li>

                location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the

            Terms of Sale, and you do not provide that personal data when requested, we may not be able to perform the
            contract we have or are trying to enter into with you. We will inform you at the time of collecting personal
            data from you whether you must provide the personal data to use the website or any of our services, and whether

            Those processing your personal data will do so only in an authorised manner and are subject to obligations of

            information provided in section 13 below.</p>
        <h3>11. Data retention</h3>
        <p>
            We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected
            it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting
            requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we
            reasonably believe there is a prospect of a legal dispute in respect of our relationship with you. To determine
            the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the
            personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the
            purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
            and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
        </p>
        <h3>12. Your legal rights</h3>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, by law you may have the right to:
        <ul>
            <li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you
                to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
            </li>
            <li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or
                inaccurate personal data we hold about you corrected.</li>
            <li>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where
                there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or
                remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we
                may have processed your personal data unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to
                comply with local law. We may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal
                reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
            <li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a
                third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
                processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the
                right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we
                may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your personal data which override your
                rights and freedoms.</li>
            <li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
                processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's
                accuracy; (b) where our use of the personal data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where
                you need us to hold the personal data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise
                or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your personal data but we need to verify
                whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
            <li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. This enables you to ask us to provide
                to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
                machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially
                provided consent for us to use or where we used the personal data to perform a contract with you.</li>
            <li>Right to withdraw consent: If you provide your consent to the processing of your personal data for a
                specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once
                we have received notification that you wish to withdraw your consent, we will take steps to ensure we no
                longer process your personal data for the purpose(s) you originally agreed to, unless we have another
                legitimate basis for doing so in law. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing
                based on consent before withdrawal.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>In order to exercise one or more of your rights in respect of your personal data, please contact us in writing

            you on our records, we will also need proof of your identity and address, and the information to which your

            account.</p>
